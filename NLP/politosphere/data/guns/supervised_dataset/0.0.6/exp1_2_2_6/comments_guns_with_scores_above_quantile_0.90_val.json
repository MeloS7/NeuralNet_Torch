In this instance the man in the photo--someone who apparently owns a gun--and the people who post on this subreddit have something in common: a distrust of the NRA and an implied want of more restrictive gun sales.  \n\nI get it. You're full of vitriol and cannot fathom why *anyone* would want to purchase a gun at all when guns are more of a problem than a solution for our society--a problem exacerbated by a gun-consumerist culture created by manufactures and normalized by the rhetoric of some very morally bankrupt people in positions of power and influence. However, the fact remains that people are still out there purchasing firearms both legally and illegally, and the fight for safety and sanity in the US is not just against the monolithic organizations that uphold \"the gun\" as the answer\/solution\/whatever, it is also for the hearts and minds of those people who are so convinced that they need and should have a weapon in the first place.  \n\nI don't like guns either. I do not buy into the idea that a gun will inherently make me safer--I find the opposite to be true--but you are building up a straw-man of a typical gun owner, and obfuscating the nuanced ideas behind why a gun purchase might be made: \n&gt; \n&gt; I simply can't comprehend why gun owners think that buying a gun gives them some greater authority with which to speak about guns in our culture  \n\nI ask that you try to understand their rationale better, because they are the ones on the other side of the debate, and you are not going to affect change if you ceaselessly vilify these people, and tune out the other voices who might have something to contribute to this ongoing national dialogue--like the guy in the picture. Yes, too many of them ascribe to the shaky logic of personal safety and derive a sense of power from owning a gun; but the act of purchasing one is not something that should be ever taken lightly, and there are those who carefully consider this when they do so. This is not always the case, and too many find work around and loop holes and excuses to game the system, but I am not going to deny that individuals who made the personal decision to purchase a gun, or several guns, have a place in the debate. Do I support their positions? Not really, no.  \n\nBuying and owning a gun is a *not* just another benign purchase. It carries with it a political subtext that, in turn, carries a lot of implications concerning the values which that gun owning individual holds dear.

This is not exactly true. In reality, the Bill of Rights was written to curb the abilities of the Federal Government, and allow the States to set their own policies with considerable leeway. The Federal Government, for example, could not pass a law limiting the right to assembly, but a state could. To quote from United State v. Cruikshank, *\u201cThe First Amendment to the Constitution, prohibiting Congress from abridging the right to assemble and petition, was not intended to limit the action of the State governments in respect to their own citizens, but to operate upon the National Government alone.\u201d*\n\nSo what does this tell us about the Second Amendment, circa 1800? On the one hand, the operative clause was supposed to be taken exactly as written *\u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"* but properly read would add in there *\"By the Federal Government\"*. On the other however, *\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\u201d* does actually mean that the Amendment was written with militia in mind, but not in a way to say that possession was tied to membership in the militia (a minor requirement to regardless, since [all men between 18 and 45](http:\/\/www.constitution.org\/mil\/mil_act_1792.htm) were anyways). Rather, read it like *\u201cThe Federal government can\u2019t ban people from owning weapons because it would be oppressive to The States\u201d.* It was delegating the regulation of arms to the States, so that they could be assured a certain level of oversight over their militias. There was no reason that, say, 1800s Pennsylvania couldn\u2019t have prohibited everyone from owning a firearm if the legislature so chose (That being said, many states had their own provisions mirroring the Bill of Rights and limiting what the states could regulate as well. The Pennsylvania Constitution, for instance, included a provision stating *\u201cThat the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state\u201d. So just because the 2nd Amendment did not protect the right to bear arms on every level should NOT BE TAKEN to imply that it wasn\u2019t nevertheless protected on the state level. Just exactly how depended on the state).\n\nAnd for 200+ years, that\u2019s essentially what the 2nd Amendment meant. There are some interesting state level rulings such as [LA] *State v Chandler* in 1850 which does give credence to guarantee of right - and alludes to how views were shifting over time some 60+ years after the BoR was written - but at the highest level, it was still fairly clear how the courts were to understand the matter. In Presser v. Illinois, in 1885, the Supreme Court reaffirmed nature of the Bill of Rights, and the 2nd Amendment, writing *\u201cBut a conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state.\u201d*\n\nBut in the early 1900s something HUGE happened. The 1925 Supreme Court case Gitlow v. New York ended with the ruling that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment applied to the States via the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause! Born from this was the process that became known as Incorporation. Slowly, the Bill of Rights began to go through this process and more and more parts of the various Amendments were incorporated against the states. Finally, by the late 60s, aside from some very minor provisions, all that remained unaddressed by SCOTUS was the 2nd and 3rd Amendments. Born from this was the assumption by most modern, casual observers, that this was always the case, and thus the assumption that the 2nd Amendment applied to the people in the same way that the 1st Amendment did, which while perhaps a safe assumption, had not yet been verified by the Supreme Court, who did not deign to address this fact in Miller, a Federal case, and the only major 2nd Amendment ruling of the modern era.\n\nIt was only in 2010, withs McDonald v. Chicago, that the right to keep a firearm was found to be an incorporated right by the Supreme Court (The earlier case with Heller, being in DC, didn't Incorporate the Amendment as DC isn't a state).\n\nNow, what does this all mean? Well, technically at least, the Founding Fathers didn\u2019t exactly mean the 2nd Amendment to be taken as we read it now. But it isn\u2019t because of the wording. It clearly grants an individual right \u201cto the people\u201d. It is because of the concept of tiered government that was held by the Founding Fathers and applied to all the Amendments, which was upended by the Incorporation Doctrine some 100+ years later. Perhaps it is an unforeseen development to the likes of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton et. al. or maybe they knew they had gotten the ball rolling and envisioned that liberal democracy was heading in that direction. It seems to be that anyone can make whatever argument that they want there, and easily find support for it. But the fact is that it did happen, and it didn\u2019t just affect the 2nd Amendment. It changed the 1st, 3rd, 4th and so one, and is a monumentally important evolution in government and the concept of rights as pertains to the United States and its citizens.\n\nSo TLDR: The 2nd Amendment, as originally written, was not meant to protect the individual\u2019s absolute right to keep and bear arms, but it ISN\u2019T because the Amendment should be read as not pertaining to the individual, but because it only applied to one level of Government. The flipside is that the 2nd Amendment protects the right to firearms for everyone, but applying it on a state level is a 20th century doctrine only made possible by the 14th Amendment that has resulted in this modern interpretation of the Bill of Rights as a whole. There absolutely was an element of 'checks and balances' there, ensuring the States had some leverage against the Federal government in the event of abject tyranny, but it is unlikely that the Founders envisioned such matters entirely independent of the states - we need only look at how Shay's Rebellion was put down, and influenced the new Constitution, to get a sense there, after all.","body_cleaned":"> is the 2nd amendment understood to be another check and balance to make sure the u.s. never goes the way of tyranny or is that something that is misconstrued ? can the answer be both ? ( cribbing from some old stuff i wrote ) it is a common misconception in regards to the bill of rights that as originally written , they were intended to protect the rights of the people from the government . this is not exactly true . in reality , the bill of rights was written to curb the abilities of the federal government , and allow the states to set their own policies with considerable leeway . the federal government , for example , could not pass a law limiting the right to assembly , but a state could . to quote from united state v. cruikshank , * \u201c the first amendment to the constitution , prohibiting congress from abridging the right to assemble and petition , was not intended to limit the action of the state governments in respect to their own citizens , but to operate upon the national government alone. \u201d * so what does this tell us about the second amendment , circa 1800 ? on the one hand , the operative clause was supposed to be taken exactly as written * \u201c the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed '' * but properly read would add in there * '' by the federal government '' * . on the other however , * \u201c a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state \u201d * does actually mean that the amendment was written with militia in mind , but not in a way to say that possession was tied to membership in the militia ( a minor requirement to regardless , since [ all men between 18 and 45 ] ( URL ) were anyways ) . rather , read it like * \u201c the federal government can \u2019 t ban people from owning weapons because it would be oppressive to the states \u201d . * it was delegating the regulation of arms to the states , so that they could be assured a certain level of oversight over their militias . there was no reason that , say , 1800s pennsylvania couldn \u2019 t have prohibited everyone from owning a firearm if the legislature so chose ( that being said , many states had their own provisions mirroring the bill of rights and limiting what the states could regulate as well . the pennsylvania constitution , for instance , included a provision stating * \u201c that the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state \u201d . so just because the 2nd amendment did not protect the right to bear arms on every level should not be taken to imply that it wasn \u2019 t nevertheless protected on the state level . just exactly how depended on the state ) . and for 200+ years , that \u2019 s essentially what the 2nd amendment meant . there are some interesting state level rulings such as [ la ] *state v chandler* in 1850 which does give credence to guarantee of right - and alludes to how views were shifting over time some 60+ years after the bor was written - but at the highest level , it was still fairly clear how the courts were to understand the matter . in presser v. illinois , in 1885 , the supreme court reaffirmed nature of the bill of rights , and the 2nd amendment , writing * \u201c but a conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of congress and the national government , and not upon that of the state. \u201d * but in the early 1900s something huge happened . the 1925 supreme court case gitlow v. new york ended with the ruling that the free speech clause of the first amendment applied to the states via the 14th amendment \u2019 s due process clause ! born from this was the process that became known as incorporation . slowly , the bill of rights began to go through this process and more and more parts of the various amendments were incorporated against the states . finally , by the late 60s , aside from some very minor provisions , all that remained unaddressed by scotus was the 2nd and 3rd amendments . born from this was the assumption by most modern , casual observers , that this was always the case , and thus the assumption that the 2nd amendment applied to the people in the same way that the 1st amendment did , which while perhaps a safe assumption , had not yet been verified by the supreme court , who did not deign to address this fact in miller , a federal case , and the only major 2nd amendment ruling of the modern era . it was only in 2010 , withs mcdonald v. chicago , that the right to keep a firearm was found to be an incorporated right by the supreme court ( the earlier case with heller , being in dc , did n't incorporate the amendment as dc is n't a state ) . now , what does this all mean ?

{"author":"fPM8e","body":"The \"left\" is a pretty diverse group of people politically, with their own interest.  I am a Black man from Chicago, I don't know whether one would call me a leftist or not, but with the exception of guns, my views line up pretty well with the social agenda of the progressive side of the isle.\n\nBlack people had a pretty long history with firearms, that was only interrupted after the northern migration.  My mother's father fed his family at 9 years old by hunting small game in Mississippi.  It was how they had meat for dinner.\n\nMy father's father, on the other hand, kept himself and his family ALIVE in Georgia with guns.  They had multiple run ins with the Klan and other lynch mobs, but the fact that he had a lot of brothers and uncles and ALL of them were HEAVILY armed dissuaded the KKK from messing with them too much.  They went after weaker prey.  Although that didn't always happen.  In one case my great uncle had to shoot a racist who was attacking him in the '30s.  I still don't know how he stayed out of jail for that, but he did.\n\nFor me, even though my grandfathers had a history with guns, I had no contact with them AT ALL until I went to college and joined the university shooting team\/club.  I did that for a year, but transferred from my school in rural Illinois, to one in Washington DC, so my shooting opportunities pretty much dried up.\n\nI would occasionally dip my toe back into the shooting sports, but in the places I lived it was such a hassle to buy a gun (Washington DC and Chicago, pre Heller) that I never bothered purchasing one.  When Illinois got concealed carry, I took my class in late 2014, but didn't even send off the paperwork until April of 2015.\n\nI might have become part of that 60-70% OF CCW permit holders who NEVER or rarely carry a gun, even though they had a permit.  That all changed with the Charleston church massacre.  Seeing that level of evil, where a person would murder a bunch of senior citizens at bible study convinced me to carry ALL THE TIME.\n\nI know that the odds of me having to use my gun against these assholes are low (but increasing every day, IMHO), but as Michael Bane said \"It's not the odds, it's the stakes\".  I am not just going to let some asshole kill me while I am on my knees, begging for my life.\n\nThere has been a definite uptick in people on the left getting interested in guns.  I have had tons of my friends ask me to go shooting, where to get training, or what type of guns to get.  Social media has helped out a lot.  People can find folks that they are comfortable shooting with without having to worry about some kind of racist\/sexist\/anti-Islamic\/anti-LGBT stuff being said.

{"author":"N0oiJ","body":"And car enthusiasts own a lot of cars, and gardeners own a lot of shovels, and musicians own a lot of instruments. \n\nBut, hey, I guess that means I'm a \"hardcore super owner\" who needs to have my guns taken away before I do something crazy. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe desire to own a gun for protection \u2013 there\u2019s a disconnect between that and the decreasing rates of lethal violence in this country. It isn\u2019t a response to actuarial reality,\u201d said Matthew Miller, a Northeastern University and Harvard School of Public Health professor and one of the authors of the study. \n\n\"Actuarial reality\" is not reality from the individual perspective. If someone does try to harm me, am I supposed to throw wadded-up statistics at them? If a woman goes to the police and says \"Help me, my boyfriend repeatedly threatened to murder me and my children\", are the police suppose to say \"No need to worry, miss, violent crime is at a record low\"? Stop denying people the agency to make their own risk assessments. Statistics won't comfort my grieving family after I fail to defend myself from an attacker.\n\n&gt; The strongest predictor of gun ownership was military service. 44% of veterans said they owned a firearm. \n\nThis is actually very interesting. Maybe something about having other people try to kill you and your friends. \n\n&gt;But as with most aspects of American gun politics, the basic data on American gun ownership is hotly debated, with some gun rights supporters arguing that American gun ownership is not on the decline, and that Americans may be under-reporting their gun ownership in some surveys.\n\n&gt;A Gallup poll last year estimated personal gun ownership at 28%, while a Pew Research Center survey put it at 31%, which would make the estimated total of American gun owners more than 75 million, compared with 55 million in the Harvard\/Northeastern study.\n\nAnd, of course, buried all the way down at the bottom is a token mention of the dissenting evidence.

{"author":"N0oiJ","body":"Guns aren't magic. They don't, in and of themselves, make you any more or less safe. It's definitely worth asking yourself whether you can really commit to shooting someone in defense of your life. IMO, the main reason domestic violence victims get killed with their own guns is that they were never prepared to actually shoot and kill their abuser. They were just hoping that gun magic would make the abuser go away.\n\nThe only appropriate time for a gun to come out is when you are about to put someone in the ground for threatening your life. It isn't to bluff, or intimidate. You don't fire warning shots. The gun stays hidden until you have to apply lethal force.

{"author":"N0oiJ","body":"In addition to the story itself, I wanted to highlight some specifically gun-related weirdness from the [FBI court filing](https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/368460353\/Taylor-Michael-Wilson-Complaint-Redacted)\n\nStrange choice of equipment for his train...hijacking...whatever:\n\n&gt;The passenger was detained by the train engineer and other Amtrak  personnel outside the train and local law enforcement was contacted. As the area near Oxford,  Nebraska is a very rural area, it took approximately one hour for the closest Deputy from the FCSO to arrive on scene. The Deputy witnessed Amtrak personnel physically restraining a single, white male later identified as TAYLOR MICHAEL WILSON on the ground. WILSON was handcuffed and helped to a standing position by the deputy and asked numerous times if he had any weapons, to which WILSON either would reply to the negative or not respond. During a subsequent search of WILSON\u2019s person, the deputy patted down the front of WILSON\u2019s pants and upon feeling a bulge in WILSON\u2019s front left pocket, the Deputy asked, \u201cWhat is this,\u201d and WILSON replied, \u201cMy dick.\u201d The deputy located a fully loaded speedloader with .38 bullets and\nupon further searching located a fully loaded 38 caliber handgun in WILSON\u2019s front waistband. WILSON would not tell Amtrak staff if he had any belongings, but passengers on the train identified a backpack belonging to WILSON which contained three additional loaded speed loaders, a box of .38 ammunition, a hammer, a fixed blade knife, tin snips, scissors, a tape measure and a respirator-style (i.e. 3M) mask similar to ones used in construction trades. \n\nThis previous incident and his incredibly bizarre reaction to it:\n\n&gt;Investigation showed WILSON has no criminal history other than a traffic citation and is the holder of a valid Missouri Concealed Handgun permit. Additional inquiries then revealed WILSON was a suspect in a road rage incident in Saint Charles, Missouri, on 4\/16\/2016. According to the St. Charles police report, the victim, a black female, stated a white male in a Green SUV pointed a handgun at her while driving eastbound on Interstate 70 for no apparent reason. The victim told police the vehicle, a green SUV bore license plate The plate was then traced back to Taylor Wilson. Wilson inexplicably tried to turn himself into  police custody by contacting park rangers at Kiwanis Park in St. Charles, but would not state the reason. The Saint Charles Police Department contacted WILSON and WILSON told them he wanted to be charged for an offense but he had nothing to say without an attorney. After putting together a photo lineup which included a photograph of WILSON, the Saint Charles PD attempted to but was unable to locate the victim in the matter so the case was placed in inactive status. \n\nThe first description of the guns recovered from his home:\n\n&gt;On 12\/ 21\/2017, FBI St. Louis executed the search warrant on the residence. Agents located the hidden compartment behind the refrigerator. Your Affiant reviewed  photographs taken at the time of the search and the compartment appears to be an area under a stairway that has been walled off, with the back of the refrigerator butting up against the wall which supports the stairs. The access panel was well camouflaged to not readily appear to be removable and was held in place by trim pieces which held it in place. Upon removing the panel agents discovered a large amount of evidence to include a tactical vest, 11 AR-15 (rifle) ammunition magazines with approximately 190 rounds of .223 ammunition, one drum-style ammunition magazine for a rifle, firearms tactical accessories (lights), 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, approximately 840 rounds of 5.45x39 rifle ammunition, white supremacy documents and paperwork, several additional handgun and rifle magazines, gunpowder, ammunition reloading supplies, and a pressure plate5. Also located in the compartment was a hand-made shield\n\nPressure plate? Hmmm. The real fun begins when an ATF consultant comes in to examine the haul:\n\n&gt;On 12\/22\/2017 your Affiant was contacted by FBI St. Louis and was informed that Special Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) had conducted a cursory inspection of the 15 firearms in FBI evidence and determined one firearm, a Pioneer Arms Corporation Model PPS43-C rifle bearing serial number MA-16438, was a fully automatic rifle. Further, a CZ Scorpion Evo 3 was converted to a short rifle, both in possible violation of federal firearms laws.\n\nStrange choice of weapon for a, remember, literal card-carrying Nazi.

{"author":"gan4I","body":"What is the criteria for deciding that the US shall be compared to the European countries but not to Mexico which has far more in common with the US than European countries in terms of size, history, ethnic diversity, and geography?\n\n\nIn comparisons of the US with other countries of the Americas, the US looks downright pacific. And why should not this comparison be made?\n\n\nIndeed, it makes more sense to compare the US to other states in the Americas than to Europe.  Comparing the US to Asian mono-ethnic countries like Japan makes even less sense. \n\n\nThe US and other countries of the Americas were settled in similar time periods. They are frontier countries settled mostly by European immigrants that displaced a native population (to varying degrees), and most of them gained independence from European imperial nations in a similar time period. They tend to have ethnically diverse populations, and many have been impacted by the slave trade that ended in the 19th century. \n\n \nEuropean countries share very few of these qualities in common with the US.\n\n\nAs far as Canada, when we look at state level data, for example, we find that states with demographics and climates similar to that of Canada also have homicide rates similar to Canada \u2014 in spite of large differences in gun laws. \n\n\nWith few gun laws New Hampshire is safer than Canada.  In New Hampshire, the homicide rate in 2014 was 0.9 homicides per 100,000, making New Hampshire in 2014 one of the safest places (in terms of homicide) on Planet Earth.  Quebec is traditionally among the most anti-gun in Canada while New Hampshire is among the least restrictive states when it comes to gun laws but in 2014, the two jurisdictions had identical homicide rates.\n\n\nSeveral other states came in with remarkably low homicide rates as well, with Minnesota reporting a rate of 1.6, Idaho at 2.0, and Iowa at 1.9 (rates measured in events per 100,000).  Indeed, the northern US in general tends to have quite low homicide rates in a global context.  Within North America, the jurisdictions with the lowest homicide rates include all of New England, the northern plains states of the US, and the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\nIf one can point to Canada and immediately conclude that gun control in those jurisdictions produced their low homicide rates, why can one not also point to New Hampshire or Oregon or Utah and the Northern Plains states and immediately conclude that their lack of gun control is the reason for their low homicide rates?\n\n\nAs the anti-gun Brady Campaign inadvertently makes clear, there is little apparent connection between homicide rates and state-level gun laws. States with more \"gun freedom\" get lower scores. For example, New Hampshire, Vermont, Idaho, and Oregon, all of which have among the lowest homicide rates in North America, get Brady Campaign scores of D-, F, F, and D+, respectively. Almost comically, Maryland and Illinois, which have homicide rates that are much higher, get scores of A- and B, respectively. Canada, meanwhile, does not have the same level of diversity in gun laws that the USA has among states.\n\nAdditionally gun grabbers like to list the homicide rate for the US and say \"why are US homicide rates higher?\" Ignored, of course, is the fact that homicide rates and gun laws differ immensely from state to state. Indeed, as of 2014, the homicide rate (at the state level) ranged from .9 per 100,000 in New Hampshire to 10.3 per 100,000 in Louisiana. Obviously, given the fact that gun laws vary substantially from state to state, it is impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions about homicides, gun laws, and their causes from the US\u2019s nationwide homicide rate. This is also relevant when making international comparisons.","body_cleaned":"what is the criteria for deciding that the us shall be compared to the european countries but not to mexico which has far more in common with the us than european countries in terms of size , history , ethnic diversity , and geography ? in comparisons of the us with other countries of the americas , the us looks downright pacific . and why should not this comparison be made ? indeed , it makes more sense to compare the us to other states in the americas than to europe . comparing the us to asian mono-ethnic countries like japan makes even less sense . the us and other countries of the americas were settled in similar time periods . they are frontier countries settled mostly by european immigrants that displaced a native population ( to varying degrees ) , and most of them gained independence from european imperial nations in a similar time period . they tend to have ethnically diverse populations , and many have been impacted by the slave trade that ended in the 19th century . european countries share very few of these qualities in common with the us . as far as canada , when we look at state level data , for example , we find that states with demographics and climates similar to that of canada also have homicide rates similar to canada \u2014 in spite of large differences in gun laws . with few gun laws new hampshire is safer than canada . in new hampshire , the homicide rate in 2014 was 0.9 homicides per 100,000 , making new hampshire in 2014 one of the safest places ( in terms of homicide ) on planet earth . quebec is traditionally among the most anti-gun in canada while new hampshire is among the least restrictive states when it comes to gun laws but in 2014 , the two jurisdictions had identical homicide rates . several other states came in with remarkably low homicide rates as well , with minnesota reporting a rate of 1.6 , idaho at 2.0 , and iowa at 1.9 ( rates measured in events per 100,000 ) . indeed , the northern us in general tends to have quite low homicide rates in a global context . within north america , the jurisdictions with the lowest homicide rates include all of new england , the northern plains states of the us , and the pacific northwest . if one can point to canada and immediately conclude that gun control in those jurisdictions produced their low homicide rates , why can one not also point to new hampshire or oregon or utah and the northern plains states and immediately conclude that their lack of gun control is the reason for their low homicide rates ? as the anti-gun brady campaign inadvertently makes clear , there is little apparent connection between homicide rates and state-level gun laws . states with more `` gun freedom '' get lower scores . for example , new hampshire , vermont , idaho , and oregon , all of which have among the lowest homicide rates in north america , get brady campaign scores of d- , f , f , and d+ , respectively . almost comically , maryland and illinois , which have homicide rates that are much higher , get scores of a- and b , respectively . canada , meanwhile , does not have the same level of diversity in gun laws that the usa has among states . additionally gun grabbers like to list the homicide rate for the us and say `` why are us homicide rates higher ?

{"author":"5dg2W","body":"&gt;Is there any problem with US gun laws? yes or no?\n\nThere's probably quite a bit, but the big one that jumps to mind is with background checks. The system itself is alright, but unfortunately not every state is required to submit reports. A background check is only as good as the information in it. Also while not gun laws themselves, enforcement is a big problem as well, or more specifically lack thereof. Our laws are pretty useless if they're not enforced well enough, and just adding more gun control laws on top of that will never fix that.\n\n&gt; if yes, what are they and how can we change it in a way that makes both sides happy? if no, why does the other side believe there is a problem and how can we convince them otherwise?\n\nThis is more like two people looking at the same thing in different ways. Neither side believes there isn't a problem, but what we have is each side disagreeing on solutions, as well as disagreeing on root causes. The gun control side views guns as the problem, while the pro gun side views the problem as violence and the guns as tools. When guns are viewed as the problem, the obvious and only logical solution is to restrict guns in part or in whole. When the problem is viewed as violence and guns as tools, people lean more towards finding ways to break down that violence into parts and find ways to reduce each part.\n\nPersonally I believe there to be little in regards to guns that should be done. Looking at the three main divisions of death and injury which is homicide, accidental, and suicide, we can look at each, or divide some further and from there look at ways to reduce them as wholes. How can we further help people that have suicidal thoughts? Guns are only half of suicidal deaths, and even without guns those people are still suicidal. What amount of accidents are preventable, and how can we work to reduce those? Only a small amount of gun deaths are accidental, and out of total accidental deaths they make up just a fraction of the total, so it seems unreasonable to focus on them.

{"author":"N0oiJ","body":"Oh my god, what-fucking-ever. \n\nThey're not \"concentration camps\". Trump is not Hitler. This is not the Holocaust. \n\nChildren cannot be detained longer than 72 hours under the Flores settlement, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, and the 2016 Ninth Circuit ruling. **There are no kids being held indefinitely in concentration camps.** It takes more than five minutes for HHS to run down family members or foster care resources to put kids with. A small number of kids have to be held because they pose an immediate risk to themselves or others. \n\nIt is currently illegal to detain children with their parents while those parents are in custody awaiting trial, where most of them will plead guilty, get sentenced to time served, and be deported. Unless the kids have been smuggled off to parts unknown by the people they get placed with, they are able to have their kids returned, though it may be difficult to arrange in some cases.\n\nThis is exactly the same thing that happens when you or I or any other American parent is jailed, and there is no spouse or immediate guardian available to take the kids. You cannot bring your kids to jail with you. They spend a brief time in Child Services custody while a guardian is found. \n\nFlores v. Sessions was an activist lawsuit attempting to use the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement (no relation) and the 2008 TVPA to force catch-and-release for anyone caught at the border with a child in tow. Pay no mind to the fact that this would have created an incentive for human traffickers to supply children for illegals to claim as their own and get released into the US. This administration effectively called the bluff by refusing to discharge illegal crossers into the US with a \"now you show up for this court date that may result in your deportation, ya hear?\". \n\nThe same goes for \"asylum seekers\". The extremely dubious nature of their claims that being admitted to the US specifically is essential to their survival aside, they also cannot be released into the US to become undocumented and blow off their hearings. As above, current case law prohibits detaining their children with them. \n\nRepublicans have proposed a bill amending the law to allow for families to be detained together until time of deportation. Diane Feinstein has introduced a Democratic bill that, by my interpretation, seems aimed at forcing catch-and-release back into policy. Obviously that's not going to happen, but Democrats don't seem willing to agree to a straightforward change, either. Little surprise for a party that is dead-set on screaming \"Trump is Hilter!\" over and over until November. \n\nThe Flores v. Sessions decision came in 2017. If Obama was still in office, *we'd be in exactly this same situation*. There are reasons this is happening that aren't \"Trump is a racist and also Hitler\". \n\nThe idea of taking up arms against the government because illegal immigrants are dragging children across the border and suffering the consequences is absurd. They are not American citizens. They had every opportunity to not put themselves in this situation. The vast majority are ultimately destined for deportation.

'' . the same goes for `` asylum seekers '' . the extremely dubious nature of their claims that being admitted to the us specifically is essential to their survival aside , they also can not be released into the us to become undocumented and blow off their hearings . as above , current case law prohibits detaining their children with them . republicans have proposed a bill amending the law to allow for families to be detained together until time of deportation . diane feinstein has introduced a democratic bill that , by my interpretation , seems aimed at forcing catch-and-release back into policy . obviously that 's not going to happen , but democrats do n't seem willing to agree to a straightforward change , either . little surprise for a party that is dead-set on screaming `` trump is hilter ! '' over and over until november . the flores v. sessions decision came in 2017. if obama was still in office , *we 'd be in exactly this same situation* . there are reasons this is happening that are n't `` trump is a racist and also hitler '' . the idea of taking up arms against the government because illegal immigrants are dragging children across the border and suffering the consequences is absurd . they are not american citizens . they had every opportunity to not put themselves in this situation . the vast majority are ultimately destined for deportation . one glaring question nobody is asking : if the trump administration is so goddamn racist and wants to exterminate all the illegals , why are they assuming the tremendous expense and responsibility of taking custody , caring for , and finding guardians for all these kids ? democrats are boiling over into complete and utter hysteria over something that , through their misguided attempts to sue their way to a free ticket across the border for every illegal , they are partially responsible for creating . like everything in government , it is never as reductionist as the media hacks and social media outrage machine want it to be . edit : the karma on this post has been a roller-coaster ride . we do not have consensus in this sub .","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1529459309,"distinguished":null,"edited":1529473337,"gilded":1,"id":"e0yrw51","language":"en","link_id":"t3_8seaq3","parent_id":"t3_8seaq3","retrieved_on":1532729869,"score":20,"subreddit":"liberalgunowners","subreddit_id":"t5_2vjre","predicted_community":2}

Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court undertook its first-ever \"in-depth examination\" of the second amendment's meaning Id. at 635.

{"author":"5dg2W","body":"The US has a violence problem way worse than other countries, that's easy to see. However it's not due to guns, they just happen to be the current best tool for the job available so it gets used the most. Even if we could snap our fingers and make every gun in the US vanish, there would still be all those violent people who would have used a gun, but instead turn to something else.\n\nLet me put this a slightly different way. Let's pretend guns vanish right this moment, and not only do the guns vanish, but all the people that would have killed using a gun, don't choose something else instead. Just the non firearm homicides would put our homicide rate above the countries we're normally compared to when it comes to this like the UK and Australia.\n\nBut unfortunately we live in a crappy world, and about 2\/3rds of our homicides aren't due to people having guns, it's due to them being violent people that want to kill others and just happen to do it with guns. You wont see any decent reduction in homicides (if any at all) simply from removing guns, because it's not the guns causing people to want to kill others.\n\n&gt;This is the perfect time for liberal gun owners to come up with a solution that is different from the right-wing absolutism.\n\nI'll give my normal spiel on the topic. Forget gun control, forget looking at things by what weapon is used, and instead look at the type of violence and causes. More research into causes of suicide, find best ways to prevent it and best way to make that prevention accessible. Homicides can be broken down further into gang violence, domestic violence, mass killings, etc. What are the leading causes of each, what steps can we take to prevent it, how can we make that accessible.\n\nIf people want to actually solve violence in this country, they need to start actually looking at the violence rather than getting distracted by the weapon used in order to choose a simple feel good solution. We've seen it before, gun control gets increased in a country, there's either no change at all, or no change caused by the gun control, but people still cheer and call it a success. The other countries we get compared to were doing better than us to begin with due to many other factors, and those should be the bigger focus.\n\nAs much as I hate that the pro gun side generally takes a no gun control stance and says little else, I can't really blame them based on my own interactions and seeing the interactions of others. For a lot of people on the gun control side they don't care about any solution you put forth, even if it makes far more sense based on the statistics we have, and will just say you're deflecting.\n","body_cleaned":"the us has a violence problem way worse than other countries , that 's easy to see . however it 's not due to guns , they just happen to be the current best tool for the job available so it gets used the most . even if we could snap our fingers and make every gun in the us vanish , there would still be all those violent people who would have used a gun , but instead turn to something else . let me put this a slightly different way . let 's pretend guns vanish right this moment , and not only do the guns vanish , but all the people that would have killed using a gun , do n't choose something else instead . just the non firearm homicides would put our homicide rate above the countries we 're normally compared to when it comes to this like the uk and australia . but unfortunately we live in a crappy world , and about 2\/3rds of our homicides are n't due to people having guns , it 's due to them being violent people that want to kill others and just happen to do it with guns . you wont see any decent reduction in homicides ( if any at all ) simply from removing guns , because it 's not the guns causing people to want to kill others . > this is the perfect time for liberal gun owners to come up with a solution that is different from the right-wing absolutism . i 'll give my normal spiel on the topic . forget gun control , forget looking at things by what weapon is used , and instead look at the type of violence and causes . more research into causes of suicide , find best ways to prevent it and best way to make that prevention accessible . homicides can be broken down further into gang violence , domestic violence , mass killings , etc . what are the leading causes of each , what steps can we take to prevent it , how can we make that accessible . if people want to actually solve violence in this country , they need to start actually looking at the violence rather than getting distracted by the weapon used in order to choose a simple feel good solution . we 've seen it before , gun control gets increased in a country , there 's either no change at all , or no change caused by the gun control , but people still cheer and call it a success . the other countries we get compared to were doing better than us to begin with due to many other factors , and those should be the bigger focus . as much as i hate that the pro gun side generally takes a no gun control stance and says little else , i ca n't really blame them based on my own interactions and seeing the interactions of others . for a lot of people on the gun control side they do n't care about any solution you put forth , even if it makes far more sense based on the statistics we have , and will just say you 're deflecting .","controversiality":0,"created_utc":1535331306,"distinguished":null,"edited":-1,"gilded":0,"id":"e4w48w8","language":"en","link_id":"t3_9ajyaw","parent_id":"t1_e4w2bwv","retrieved_on":1537965808,"score":42,"subreddit":"liberalgunowners","subreddit_id":"t5_2vjre","predicted_community":2}

{"author":"wwigw","body":"Mostly just lurk here, but found this on my feed this morning so thought I'd share, as it seemed like of broad community interest. It also fits into my own perspective on the issue of gun control and gun violence, so it was heartening to see studies coming out that give support to what admittedly is more a gut feeling, even if one I'm fairly confident in. I would however disagree with one key point made by the *reviewer*:\n\n&gt;He presents a vision for dealing with urban violence by fundamentally rethinking how law enforcement and other government resources are used \u2014 a cost-effective solution that could save lives, **while being more palatable to both political parties than sweeping gun control.**\n\nWhile it might be *more* palatable, it nevertheless feels like it is pushing a solidly liberal, progressive agendas.

{"author":"N17Qy","body":"Might be because i am pro-gun ;) I own a handfull because we are not permitted to own more than 5 and practice IPSC and 100m military target. I also don't remember making an anti-gun statement? Anyway, to your reply:\nThe pre-crime part is nonexistant, because it is post-crime. If you are convicted for a crime and served more than 12 months in jail, you can't get a gun anymore here (The Netherlands, that is). Well, legally anyway ;) Same goes for people that have been hospitalised for severe mental problems. That way they filter out the people posing a possible threat to society again. Or at least they hope so, in the Netherlands we had an incident where someone that ticked the mental boxes got guns and he emptied them at a mall. The police didn't follow procedures and he got a permit. It took 10 years and several lawsuits to get the police to admit their error.\nI used the shotgun as example because they are really easy  to fabricate (two pipes, an endcap and a screw) but hey, kudo's to his workshop skills.\nAnd for the Balkans part, when I showed interest in an AK74 mag at some local market in Croatia, the guy asked me if i'd like the rifle and ammo with it, no paperwork needed except Euro's.\n\nPoint is, the (4chan?)
