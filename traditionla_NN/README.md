# NeuralNet_Torch

I really wish chatGPT could have been born a few years earlier. 

Here, I will follow the code examples from chatGPT to implement some classical neural network models with PyTorch.

Here is list of nets:

- Linear Regression

- Classification (can be suitable for n-class)

- Convolutional Neural Network (Test Accuracy reached more than 98%)

- Recurrent Neural Network (doing)
